  title: AMP microsite with Grow
  subtitle: >-
      This is a basic demonstration that shows how to use Grow to build an AMP
      valid microsite. What you see on this site is entirely controlled by
      the union of  files and template files. Content is kept separate from
      presentation. Some of the pages use YAML and partial templates, other
      pages just use Markdown. Try exploring.
